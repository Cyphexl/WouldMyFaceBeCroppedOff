Just as its name suggests.

In May 2017, a new version of [TWT Coders landing page](https://coder.twtstudio.com/) was ready to be deployed. Members of TWT Studio were expected to upload a photo of themselves in order to be displayed on the page, and the picture could be in arbitrary length-width ratio whereas the layout was designed to place square images only. Some of them kept asking questions like "How would it be displayed", "Would my face be cropped off". So I designed & implemented this simple demo, just to make things clear.

Nothing fancy, `background-size: cover` it is.
